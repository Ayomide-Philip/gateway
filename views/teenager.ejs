                    <p><strong>Sunday Services:</strong> </p>
                    <p>Our Sunday services for teenagers are dynamic and relevant, featuring contemporary worship,
                        engaging
                        messages, and interactive discussions. We focus on addressing the real-life issues that teens
                        face and
                        providing biblical guidance and encouragement. These services are led by Miss Tudun and Pastor
                        Samuel, who
                        has a heart for youth ministry and a passion for helping teens connect with God.</p>

                        space for
                        teens to share their struggles, ask questions, and support one another. Led by experienced and
                        caring
                        leaders like Pastor Mrs. Ogunjimi and Pastor Mr. Adedutan, these groups foster deep connections
                        and
                        spiritual growth.</p>
